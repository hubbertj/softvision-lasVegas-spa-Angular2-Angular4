# Thumbtack-Slot-Machine
This is a coding challenge provided by Thumbtack.com 
You may use standard libraries like jQuery, Underscore, Backbone, and/or Angular.

Your slot machine should have three reels:

The first reel has a coffee maker, a teapot, and an espresso machine.
The second reel has a coffee filter, a tea strainer, and an espresso tamper.
The third reel has coffee grounds, loose tea, and ground espresso beans.

When the lever is pulled (you can simulate this with the click of a button), the slot machine goes into action. Each reel spins and randomly stops on one of the three options. If the user is lucky, the three reels will line up and she will be rewarded with a tasty hot beverage. Your solution should show the user what beverage she's won. For example, if the reels show coffee maker, coffee filter, and coffee grounds, the user wins a cup of coffee.


notes:
--------
To start the server you need to install node.js and in the command line run:

	node app.js 

This will start the server and just do a localhost:3000 to see the site.
NOTE: (This project will have all the node.js libs need to run the server but the .LESS files
will need to be precessed into css files inorder for the project to look correctly.)
